# Introduction to ontologies

Based on [CL editors training](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11WeCHCeGYSPEO7hUYFTdPivptxX4ajj5pVHDm24j4JA/edit#slide=id.g9a5e4d7c09_0_221) by David Osumi-Sutherland

## Why do we need ontologies 

### We can't find what we're looking for
- Too flexible, multiple options, no enforcement standards 
    - standardized
    - quasi-standardized
    - non-standardized
- Data at varying depth or granularity

For example, in NCBI BioSample: 

### We don’t know what we’re talking about

Because we have no single reference glossary the result is millions of statements that are not obviously related
 
Here is the male genitalia of a gasteruptiid wasp, and these 5 different structures here have each been labeled "paramere" - by different people, studying different hymenopteran lineages - how do we know what "paramere" means when it is referred to?
