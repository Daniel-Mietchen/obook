# Ontology Pipelines with ROBOT and SPARQL

## Prerequisites
- Install ODK
- **Optional**: [download ROBOT](http://robot.obolibrary.org) so you can use it outside of Docker (scroll down to the end of the ROBOT page to find the Windows instructions)

## Preparation
- Complete the [ROBOT Mini-Tutorial 1](../tutorial/robot_tutorial_1.md) to learn your first ROBOT commands: `convert`, `extract` and `template`
- Complete the [ROBOT Mini-Tutorial 2](../tutorial/robot_tutorial_2.md) to learn about `annotate`, `merge`, `reason` and `diff`
- Complete [Running Basic SPARQL Queries](https://medium.com/virtuoso-blog/dbpedia-basic-queries-bc1ac172cc09) tutorial (~45 minutes - 1 hour)

## What is delivered as part of the course

**Description:**  We will learn about building high quality ontologies with reuse and design patterns. First, we will cover the various "flavors" of ontology languages. We will talk about how to reuse pieces of existing ontologies as imports. Then, we will dive deeper into using the ROBOT command line tool to extract these import modules and build full ontologies from design patterns in spreadsheets (ROBOT templates).

<!--
We will continue to combine our previous work into workflows for daily ontology development in OBO. First, we will learn a few more ROBOT commands to help us edit and release ontologies: [`merge`](http://robot.obolibrary.org/merge), [`reason`](http://robot.obolibrary.org/reason), and [`annotate`](http://robot.obolibrary.org/annotate). Then, we will get an introduction to [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and see how Makefiles are used for creating ontology releases. Finally, we will learn how to use the [Ontology Development Kit](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit) (ODK) to start a new ontology and see how ROBOT and Makefiles are combined.

By the end of this unit, you should be able to:
- Find terms from other ontologies to reuse in your ontology
- Extract those terms from the external ontology using ROBOT and import them into your ontology
- Identify ontology design patterns for the logical definitions in your ontology
- Create ROBOT templates using the ontology design patterns and use them to add to your ontology
