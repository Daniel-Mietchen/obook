## Resolve conflicts on branch

Conflicts arise when edits are made on two separate branches to the same line in a file. ([reference](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-conflicts#:~:text=A%20conflict%20arises%20when%20two,to%20help%20resolve%20merge%20conflicts)). When editing an ontology file (owl file or obo file), conflicts often arise when adding new terms to an ontology file on separate branches, or when there are a lot of open pull requests.

Conflicts in ontology files can be fixed either on the command line or using GitHub Desktop.
