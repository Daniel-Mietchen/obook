# Contributing to OBO Semantic Engineering Tutorials

We rely on our readers to correct our materials and add to them - the hope is to centralise all the usual teaching materials for OBO ontology professionals in one place. Feel free to:

- Request new lessons (video/how-to guides) on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jamesaoverton/obook/issues)
- Make a [pull request](https://github.com/jamesaoverton/obook/pulls) if you find errors or want to add some clarifying remarks. All files of the OBOAcademy website can be found in the [docs directory](https://github.com/OBOAcademy/obook/tree/master/docs). The Table of Contents is edited [here](https://github.com/OBOAcademy/obook/blob/master/mkdocs.yml).
- Join the OBO slack space (`#obo-training` channel) to ask any questions (you can request access on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jamesaoverton/obook/issues))
