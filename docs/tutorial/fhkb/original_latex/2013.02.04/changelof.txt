1.4: NICO: URL does not exist

3.4: ADDED NOTE: todo("something about inconsistency")
We can cause the ontology to be inconsistent, for example by providing facts that cannot be accommodated by the model of our ontology. In the example, \ds was inferred to be a member of two disjoint classes (contraction!).
CONTRADICTION

Beginnning of chapter 4 I put a warning:

OK 4.0: ADDED NOTE: At this point we expect your working version of the \fhkb to include a list of individuals that represent all the family members listed in Table~\ref{tab:familydata}. You can either just add them all upfront (now); or add them as you go along; or visit \fhkbhome for an importable version of raw list of individuals. You should not assert anything about the individuals yet. We will do that during the cause of the following chapters.

OK 5.4: REPLACED hasBloodRelation from summary -> hasRelation.

ROBERT TODO 7.3: Explain why OWL cannot deal with Half Siblings

NICO TODO Figure 7.5 is missing: The object property hierachy with aunt an uncle included

ROBERT TODO 8.3: Cousins peculiar inferences paragraph. It says "check and finish"
ROBERT TODO 8.4: "Perhaps a bit more about negation?"

ROBERT TODO 9.1: What does the last task mean:  Robert's grandparents were married in 1929 on the paternal side and 1926 on the maternal side.
I commented it out for now.

ROBERT TODO 11: OWL actually not much good for FH
ROBERT TODO 11: Simple and Complex properties

NICO TODO: -- create importable versions of the various states of the FHKB as well as snapshots of the ontology
