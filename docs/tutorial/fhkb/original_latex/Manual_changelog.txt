Various
-- Macros all the way through, remove xspace from templates!
-- Pizza tutorial layout
-- Most important richard, Robert, Margret, David, William George, Iris Ellen
-- Check references to pictures and tables, often wrong, also in 7.1 the refs to dmitrys papers.
-- create a caption for every picture
-- Add Margaret to list of contributors
-- Check in chapter 3.1 assumptions about 'which individuals have a father' for a2.
-- in 4.1, maybe add a comment that range and domain of course are inherited down the line
-- check literature references in 4.2
-- 5.1, 5.2: Superproperty of still in Manchester Syntax code.. 
-- 5.3: Class equality: we never created the Parent or Father classes! I removed it.
-- 7.4: Adding greatuncle of would simply be a pain. Do you want to leave it anyways?
-- 7.4 Turn something on in Protege: show all inferred facts for individuals.

Concentions
-- All OWL is written in Manchester Syntax;
-- When we use \fhkb entities within text, we use a \con{sans serif typeface};
-- We use CamelCase for classes and property names;
-- Class names start with upper case;
-- Individual names start with a lower case letter and internal underscores to break words;
-- Property names usually start with `is' or `has' and are CamelCase with a lower case initial letter.



--- to SPACE--SPACE

- What about names? Always correct, or leave it like is?
- sub-properties, subproperties, subclasses, super-properties?
- nothing maybe should be spelled Nothing
- DL query or DL-Query
- sub-property chains should be property chains?
- Normalize the code display (whitepace!, lower case o for chains, SubProperty instead of PropertyChain?).
- cha: to chap:
- Labels of tables out of the caption!
- ref to tab:parentage to tab:parents in chapter "individuals"

Suggestions:

Introduction
- Reference to Pizza Tutorial (1.2)
- What is a "yers"(1.2)?
- is Chapter capital everywhere?
- such as that in Figure 10.1" WRONG, 1.1!
- "such as that" to "such as the one"?
- quotes: ' or the other single thing? (apostrophe)

Modelling Person
- Do every modelling step once.
- Check manchester syntax
- Entities like \person or \man should be formatted without the trailing whitespace

Instances
- tab:parentage non existent.
- Name normalization: All Upper Case?
