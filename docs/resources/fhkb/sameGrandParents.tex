\steps{Are sibling's grandparents the same?}{
\item Make two defined classes \con{GrandparentOfRobert} and \con{GrandparentOfRichard}. Use the pattern \con{Person and EquivalentTo: isParentOf some (Person and isParentOf value x)} where x is either \irds or \irjs.
\item Run the reasoner and find out if the two classes are found to be equivalent; they won't be, despite the fact \rds and \rjs share parents and therefore share the same grandparents.
\item It doesn't work. If you add \con{hasParent max 2 Person} as a restriction to the class \person (only as a necessary condition), re-run the reasoner, then everything will work. You'll see that the two classes have been inferred to be equivalent.
\item It's all to do with openness; ask a human being or read the full \fhkb manual.
