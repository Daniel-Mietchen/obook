\section*{Conventions used in these exercises}

\begin{itemize}
\item All OWL is written in Manchester Syntax;
\item When we use \fhkb entities within text, we use a \con{sans serif typeface};
\item We use CamelCase for classes and property names;
\item Class names start with upper case;
\item Individual names start with a lower case letter and internal underscores to break words;
\item Property names usually start with `is' or `has' and are CamelCase with a lower case initial letter.
\item When there is some scary OWL or the reasoner may find the \fhkb hard work, you will see a `here be dragons' image\herebedragons.\footnote{The image comes from \url{http://ancienthomeofdragon.homestead.com/} May 2012.}
