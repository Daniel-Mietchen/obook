\steps{Grandparent as a defined class}{
\item Make the class \con{Parent} as \con{EquivalentTo:  Person  and isParentOf some Person}.
\item Make two defined classes, \con{Grandparent1} and \con{Grandparent2};  in one use the \con{isGrandparentOf} property and in the other use \con{isParentOf some (Person and isParentOf some Person)}.
\item Run the reasoner  and look at the class hierarchy. Do both classes appear as subclasses of \con{Parent} as they should (all grandparents are, by definition, parents) and are they equivalent? think about it.
