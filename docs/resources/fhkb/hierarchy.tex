\steps{Making a big class hierarchy}{
\item Add defined classes for the following (some may already exist):
\begin{itemize}
\item Son and Daughter;
\item Brother and Sister;
\item Cousin, FirstCousin, SecondCousin, FirstCousinOnceRemoved (and so on until you get bored);
\item InLaw, MotherInLaw, FatherInLaw and so on;
\item Aunt, Uncle, UncleInLaw, and so on;
\item GrandParent, Grandfather, GreatGrandparent, and so on; 
\end{itemize}
\item Look at how the class hierarchy grows; its shape and any `unusual' placements; use explanation widely to check on your growing hierarchy.
\item Note what happens to the classes \con{Son} and \con{Daughter} in the hierarchy---why?
