\steps{Adding birth years}{
\item Add a data property \con{hasBirthYear} with a domain \person and range \con{integer}.
\item Add the birth years from the data table.
\item Run the reasoner.
\item Ask DL queries for people born after 1930, before 1970 and during the 1960s.
\item Ask the DL query \con{isParentOf min 3 Person}; note the answer.
\item Make \con{hasBirthYear} functional; run the reasoner and ask the query again. Ask the DL query \con{hasFather value peter\_william\_bright\_1940}---why doesn't he have three children?
\item Make all individuals different, run the reasoner and ask the DL query \con{isParentOf min 3 Person} again; note the answer.
\item You should also make \con{hasFather} and \con{hasMother} functional; we want individuals of type \person to have only one mother and father. Try giving a person more than one father, run the reasoner and ask for an explanation of what happens.
