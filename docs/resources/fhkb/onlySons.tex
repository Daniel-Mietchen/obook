\steps{Finding parents with only sons}{
\item Ask the DL query \con{isParentOf some Man}; note the answer.
\item The query finds someone that has at least one son; we want a query that asks for  people that are parents of only sons.
\item Ask the DL query \con{isParentOf only Man}; note the answer. Are there any unusual answers?
\item We need to `close off' what people individuals are parents of. For \ds we do this with an axiom such as \con{isParentOf only \{\irjs, \irds\}}. Add such axioms to your \fhkb's individuals (\ds, for instance, should have such an axiom.)   and ask the questions again, noting the answers.  (note how fast the reasoner runs.)
\item Now write a defined class \con{ParentOfOnlySons}. this will be something like:

\con{EquivalentTo:  Person and isParentOf some Man and isParentOf only Man}.

\item Run the reasoner; where is the class placed in the TBox; which individuals are members of this class?
