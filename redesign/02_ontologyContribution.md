# Ontology Contribution

## Prerequisites
Participants will need to have access to the following resources and tools prior to the training:
- **GitHub account** - register for a free GitHub account [here](https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home)
- **Protege** - Install Protege 5.5, download it [here](https://protege.stanford.edu/)

#### Install **ELK 0.5** 
- - Click here to get the latest [Protege Plugin latest build](https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/content?r=snapshots&g=org.semanticweb.elk&a=elk-distribution-protege&e=zip&v=LATEST) (this is available on the bottom of [ELK pages](https://github.com/liveontologies/elk-reasoner/wiki/GettingElk). This will download a zipped file.)
  
  - When downloaded, unzip and copy puli and elk jars (two .jar files) in the unpacked directory.
  -  Paste these files in your Protege plugin directory.
 
##### Install ELK plugin on Mac:

This can be done via one of two ways:

**Approach 1**

  1. Paste these files in your Protege plugin directory. This is in one of two locations:
      - ~/.Protege/plugins (note this is usually hidden from finder, but you can see it in the terminal) or
      - Go to Protege in Applications (Finder), right click, 'Show package contents' -> Java -> plugins
  1. Copy and paste the two files into the plugins directory
  1. Restart Protege. You should see ELK 0.5 installed in your Reasoner menu. 

For a video showing how to install Elk on a Mac, click [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/n3td2n48xmwd3mj/Install_ELK_0.5.mov?dl=0)   

**Approach 2**

  1. In Terminal:
      `open ~/.Protege, then click on plugins`
  2. Click on plugins
  3. Copy and paste the two files into the plugins directory
  4. Restart Protege. You should see ELK 0.5 installed in your Reasoner menu. 
      
 Important: it seems Elk 0.5. Does not work with all versions of Protege, in particular, 5.2 and below. These instructions were only tested with Protege 5.5.
