# GitHub workflows


GitHub - distributed version control (Git) + social media for geeks who like to build code/documented collaboratively.

A Git repo consists of a set of branches each with a complete history of all changes ever made to the files and directories. This is true for a local copy you check out to your computer from GitHub or for a copy (fork) you make on GitHub.

A Git repo typically has a master or main branch that is not directly editing.  Changes are made by creating a branch from Master (complete copy of the Master + its history).
