-   make pull requests to GitHub
-   create tickets in GitHub

# Outline

1. Download the Mondo ontology from GitHub (see instructions [here](https://github.com/jamesaoverton/obook/blob/master/04-OntologyTheory/github-workflow.md)).
2. Open Mondo in Protege and browse and [search Mondo](https://github.com/jamesaoverton/obook/blob/master/04-OntologyTheory/SearchingMondo.md).
3. Do [basic edits in Mondo](https://github.com/jamesaoverton/obook/blob/master/04-OntologyTheory/editing-mondo.md) and make a [pull request](https://github.com/jamesaoverton/obook/blob/master/04-OntologyTheory/pull-request.md) (PR).
4. [Add new terms to Mondo](https://github.com/jamesaoverton/obook/blob/master/04-OntologyTheory/add-new-terms.md) and make a [PR](https://github.com/jamesaoverton/obook/blob/master/04-OntologyTheory/pull-request.md).
5. Understand the basics of writing a good ticket
