### Setup

#### Setting Preferences for New entities

Ontology terms have separate names and IDs. The names are annotation values (labels) and the IDs are represented using IRIs. The OBO foundry has a policy on IRI (or ID) generation (<http://www.obofoundry.org/principles/fp-003-uris.html>). You can set an ID strategy using the "New Entities" tab under the Protégé Preferences -- on the top toolbar, click the "Protégé dropdown, then click Preferences.
