Create a fork from GitHub
-------------------------

Note: Creating a fork allows you to create your copy of the Mondo Ontology. You can't break the Mondo by editing your forked copy.

1.  Prior to starting - make sure you have created a GitHub account

2.  On GitHub, navigate to https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo

3.  In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.

1.  When prompted 'Where should we fork mondo', choose your own repo (eg Nicole Vasilevsky).

1.  Be careful if you have multiple forks (i.e. the original and your own personal fork, as this can cause confusion).

3.  Clone your forked repo:

1.  If you have GitHub Desktop installed - click Code -> Open with GitHub Desktop

5.  How are you planning to use this fork? To contribute to parent project

6.  In GitHub Desktop, create a new branch:

1.  Click Current Branch - > New Branch

1.  Give your branch a name, like c-path-training-1

2.  You will make changes to the Mondo on the branch of your local copy.
