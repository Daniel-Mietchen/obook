# Week 09: Diseases and Phenotypes

**First Instructor:** Nico Matentzoglu  
**Second Instructor:** Nicole Vasilevsky

## Description
We are introducing the landscape of disease and phenotype ontologies, and sketch some of the ways they can be used to add value to your analysis.

## Learning Outcomes:
- be aware of major disease and phenotype ontologies that are available
- be able to decide which phenotype or disease ontology to use for different use cases
- understand how to leverage disease and phenotype ontologies for advanced data analytics
- have a basic understanding of where to find data (_Note: It is impossible to provide a comprehensive list_)

## Preparation
- This week, the preparation will consistent only of installing software and running some scripts to prepare for the lesson. It is possible that this takes you only 30 minutes - but odds are, that there issues along the way that need to be ironed out. In summary, we want you to install Jupyter notebooks and python 3 to run mapping analyses. 
- Install [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/)
  - In most circumstances, on Windows, you should use the the 64-Bit installer
- Clone 
- Run jupyter notebook

- Kinds of analyses that can be done with disease and phenotype ontologies
	- how to link phenotypes to diseases
	- match phenotypic profiles
	- how to link phenotypes across organisms
