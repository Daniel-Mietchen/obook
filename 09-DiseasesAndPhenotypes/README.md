# Week 09: Diseases and Phenotypes

**First Instructor:** Nico Matentzoglu  
**Second Instructor:** Nicole Vasilevsky

## Description
Using OBO for diseases and phenotypes, mapping standards. 

## Learning Outcomes:
- be aware of major disease and phenotype ontologies that are available
- how to choose which ontologies to use for what purpose
- understand how to leverage disease and phenotype ontologies for advanced data analytics
- have a basic understanding of where to find data (_Note: It is impossible to provide a comprehensive list_)

## Topics
- [Landscape of ontologies](ontologylandscape.md)
- Kinds of analyses that can be done with disease and phenotype ontologies
	- how to link phenotypes to diseases
	- match phenotypic profiles
	- how to link phenotypes across organisms

## New Material
- Mapping to triples (review of [week 03](https://github.com/jamesaoverton/obook/tree/master/03-RDF))
  - For example, how to a match phenotype description strings and annotate to ontologies
- link your data to disease and phenotype ontologies
- analyze your data across multiple different disease and phenotype ontologies
- integrate phenotype data from across resources and organisms
- link phenotypes to diseases
