# Week 2: Linked Data and Controlled Vocabularies

- **First Instructor:** Nico Matentzoglu
- **Second Instructor:** Nicole Vasilevsky

## Description
We discuss the basic ideas behind behind Linked Data and the Semantic Web, and describe relevant sub-communities, tools and standards.

## Content
- [Basic Linked data and Semantic Web Concepts](linked-data.md)
- [The Semantic Web Landscape](linked-data-landscape.md)

## OpenHPI Courses

The open courses of the [Hasso Plattner Institute](https://open.hpi.de/) (HPI) offer introductions into the concepts around Linked Data, Semantic Web and Knowledge Engineering. There are three courses of relevance to this weeks topics, all of which overlap significantly.

- [Knowledge Engineering and the Web of Data](https://open.hpi.de/courses/semanticweb2015/overview): The oldest (2015), of the courses, but the most thorough when it comes to logical foundations, semantics and OWL. We will come back to this course in Weeks 4 and 5.
- [Linked Data Engineering](https://open.hpi.de/courses/semanticweb2016/overview): Overlaps a lot with the [Knowledge Engineering and the Web of Data](https://open.hpi.de/courses/semanticweb2015/overview) course, with a bit more RDF/Linked Data focus. 
- [Knowledge Graphs](https://open.hpi.de/courses/knowledgegraphs2020/overview): The most up-to-date of the three courses (2020), and will be referred to again in Week 12 of our course here.
