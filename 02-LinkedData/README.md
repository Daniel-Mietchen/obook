# Week 2: Linked Data and Controlled Vocabularies

**First Instructor:** Nico Matentzoglu  
**Second Instructor:** Nicole Vasilevsky

## Description
We discuss the basic ideas behind behind Linked Data and the Semantic Web, and describe relevant sub-communities and how they relate to the wider vision.

## Outline
- Linked data, Semantic Web
  - Before the Semantic Web
    - Tower of babel
    - Unstructured text
  - Anatomy:
    - From URIs via triples to complex knowledge models
  - Ecosystem:
    - Technologies and standards
      - From standards (RDF, OWL) to formats (JSON-LD, RDFXML)
    - From semantic markup to ontologies and knowledge graphs
    - Important research areas
      - Ontology/Knowledge graph alignment
      - Entity Recognition
      - Knowledge Graphs and Machine Learning
        - Link Prediction
        - Embeddings

      - Reasoning?
  - Delineation: *Where does the Semantic Web End?*
    - Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
      - SWRL and other Rule-based formalisms
      - Knowledge Representation beyond OWL
    - FAIR data
      - FAIR vs Linked Data Principles
