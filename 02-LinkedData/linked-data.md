# Introduction to Linked Data and the Semantic Web

## Background reading

## Some Words about Terms

## Before the Semantic Web
- Tower of babel
- Unstructured text

## Anatomy of Linked Data
  - From URIs via triples to complex knowledge models
  - https://github.com/jamesaoverton/obo-tutorial/blob/master/docs/names.md
  - Identifiers, CURIEs

## The Ecosystem of Linked Data and Semantic Web: Standards, Technologies and Research Areas

- Technologies and standards
  - From standards (RDF, OWL) to formats (JSON-LD, RDFXML)
- From semantic markup to ontologies and knowledge graphs
- Important research areas
  - Ontology/Knowledge graph alignment
  - Entity Recognition
  - Knowledge Graphs and Machine Learning
    - Link Prediction
    - Embeddings
  - [Pods](https://solidproject.org/)
  - Reasoning?
