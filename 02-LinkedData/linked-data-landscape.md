# The Linked Data landscape from an OBO perspective: Standards, Services and Tools
- Landscape (focus on this and make sure this is covered)
  - Linked data in biomedical sciences
    - Finding data
    - Annotating data (so it becomes discoverable)
    - Analysing data  
  - Important vocabularies/knowledge graphs and a realistic view of their utility
    - [Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud](https://lod-cloud.net/): The flagship project of the Semantic Web. An attempt to make all, or anyways a lot, of linked data accessible in one giant knowledge graph. A good overview can be found in [this](https://medium.com/virtuoso-blog/what-is-the-linked-open-data-cloud-and-why-is-it-important-1901a7cb7b1f) medium article.
    - [Schema.org](https://schema.org/): General purpose vocabulary for entities on the web. To get a better sense of the types of entities and relationships covered see [here](https://schema.org/docs/full.html).
    - [Friend of a friend (FOAF)](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/): A previously popular vocabulary that has been used mainly for encoding information about people in a structured manner. In the end, the uptake was quite limited, but you will find `foaf:` entities everywhere in Linked Data repositories.
    - [DBpedia](https://www.dbpedia.org/): Project that extracts structured data from Wikipedia and makes it available as a giant knowledge graph. The [associated ontology](http://mappings.dbpedia.org/server/ontology/classes/), similar to schema.org, covers entities encountered in common sense knowledge.
    - [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page): Free and open knowledge base that can be edited in much the same way as Wikipedia is edited.
  - The biomedical domain
    - Where to find ontologies: Ontology repositories
      - OBO Foundry Ontology Library
      - [BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/)
        - [CPT Story](https://www.bioontology.org/why-bioportal-no-longer-offers-the-current-procedural-terminology-cpt/). The Current Procedural Terminology was the by far most highly accessed Terminology on Bioportal - for many years. Due to license concerns, it had to be withdrawn from the repository. This story serves a cautionary tale of using terminologies with non-open or non-transparent licensing schemes.
      - [AgroPortal](http://agroportal.lirmm.fr/)
    - Term browsers
      - OLS
      - Ontobee
      - AberOWL
      - identifiers.org
    - The most important biomedical ontologies
      - What does "important" mean?
      - SNOMED vs OBO vs NCIt
      - EFO
    - Applications:
      
      - RightField
      - CEDAR
      - Populous/Webulous
      - Open Refine
    - Standards:
      - The Layer Cake
    - Some larger efforts in the biomedical domain that make significant use of ontologies:
      - [Open Targets](https://www.opentargets.org/)
      - A lot of Covid-19 knowledge graphs
        - [KG Covid 19]()

## Evolution and the "Semantic Battlegrounds"
- *The* Semantic Web vs Semantic Web Technologies
  - Linked Open Data Cloud vs Semantic Web Layer Cake

  - Why do we need OWL Reasoning?
- OWL vs OBO
  - The History of the OBO Format
  - The Future of the OBO Format
- SKOS vs OWL (Taxonomies vs Ontologies)
- Human vs Machine Curation
- Linked Data Principles vs. FAIR principles vs OBO principles
- Triple stores vs LPG Databases
