## Add New Terms to Mondo: 

### EDITING

#### Creating a new class

Before you start:

- make sure you have set your preferences in Protege (see instructions [here](https://github.com/jamesaoverton/obook/blob/master/04-OntologyTheory/add-new-terms.md).

-   make sure you are working on a branch - see quick guide [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1M8NZQOIQVswng-so6ROxVeMJfDnzth7BYNj_5MXxEik/edit#slide=id.g9db6baf776_1_0).

-   make sure you have the editor's file open in Protege as detailed [here](https://github.com/jamesaoverton/obook/blob/master/04-OntologyTheory/SearchingMondo.md).

New classes are created in the Class hierarchy panel on the left.

There are three buttons at the top of the class hierarchy view. These allow you to add a subclass (L-shaped icon), add a sibling class (c-shaped icon), or delete a selected class (x'd circle).

Practice adding a new term:

#### Add the new term 'mycotoxin allergy'

1. Search for the parent term 'allergic disease' (see [search guide](https://github.com/jamesaoverton/obook/blob/master/04-OntologyTheory/SearchingMondo.md) if you are unsure how to do this).
1. When you are clicked on the term in the Class hierarchy pane, click the add subclass button to add a child class to 'allergic disease'
1. A dialog will popup. Name this new subclass: mycotoxin allergy. Click "OK" to add the class.

#### Add a logical axiom 

Equivalence axioms in Mondo are added according to Dead Simple Ontology Design Patterns (DOSDPs). You can view all of the design patterns in Mondo by going to [code/src/patterns/dosdp-patterns/](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo/tree/master/src/patterns/dosdp-patterns)
